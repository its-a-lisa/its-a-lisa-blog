# Making the move to Twitter lists

## Problem Statement:
- Don't engage the way I want to engage
- Not seeing threads from people
- Feel like I am staying in my bubble too much
 
## Approach:
- Extract who I am following now
- Group into lists
- Automate it so I can easily add to it later

## Considerations

- Public or Private Lists

| Visibility | Pro | Con |
| ---------- | --- | --- |
| Private | --- | - Can't share list with others |
| Public | - Easy to share with others | - People on list get notified |
