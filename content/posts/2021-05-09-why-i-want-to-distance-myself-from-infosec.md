On May 8th, 2020 -- I took a step to liberate myself. I told my world of 10.3k Twitter followers that I was distancing myself from #infosec.

I later followed up with executing an intention that I had months ago with better managing my Twitter feed.



Why did I do it?

Simply, because it was bringing me more negative energy into my life than positive energy into my life. 

To understand the declaration, you first have to realize that since 2012, I had lost a part of who I was as a person because I filled up mental real estate encompassing #infosec as a part of my being. 

This is something that is typically celebrated, encouraged and propogated throughout the community. But, what I realize now that I hadn't realized back then is that "things change". I structed my life in a way that changing that part of it, was not only reconstructing a piece of my professional life, but it required rehauling the whole foundation.
