A scenario happened to me that is all too familiar -- I tried to find an email and realized that my inbox was too clunky and it was a futile attempt. This was not the first time or a new thing to happen, but the timing did happen to be at the end of an already frustrating year. Therefore, it led me to declare publically that I was going to Do Something About It. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think in honor 2020 being a shit year &amp; my progress with treating my OCD/OCPD (which hoarding is a symptom)... <br><br>... I am going to declare &#39;Mailbox Zero&#39; with physical and virtual mail. <a href="https://t.co/uF1f5ktQPw">pic.twitter.com/uF1f5ktQPw</a></p>&mdash; Alyssa Feola (@its_a_lisa) <a href="https://twitter.com/its_a_lisa/status/1344733460498419714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So, now I had to put my money where my mouth was ... and do it!

This blog is going to document the journey I went on to turn this declaration into a reality. It is going to be a two-part blog because 99% of my physical mail is located offsite. After all, my hoarding of it became so bad. 

## Background

### The problem:

* Too many email addresses. 
* Just a collection of junk emails. 
* Increased attack vector.
* Hard to find the emails that really mattered. 

### What I'm looking to achieve:

* Get rid of all of my current emails.
* Have a backup of the emails.
* A system to not let this happen going forward. 

## The process

1. Use Google Takeout to export the data
2. Wait 3 days
3. Validate the data exported properly by importing it locally using Thunderbird
4. Delete all mail from inbox
5. Unsubscribing from services
6. Setting up OOO and mail forwarding for old email addresses
