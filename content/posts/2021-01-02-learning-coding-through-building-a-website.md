I built this website and have run into a variety of unexpected things, all great lessons. 

## Web Development Lessons

* There are many types of styling approaches. 

## its-a-lisa.com specific lessons

* Tags can't start with a number. 
* There needs to be at least one Post that the `draft` attribute is set to `true` or an error will be thrown for the whole site.
* When updating the `pages` from the Content Management System, need to go back into the GitHub file to add the quotes around the input.
* When putting in an embedded tweet to a blog post directly from a GitHub push, it won't format properly. It will format properly when pushed from the CMS.
